# Individual Project 

### Problem Statement

Food goes bad, especially when you run a restaurant and have a lot to keep track of. 
This application will allow users to keep track of food products with dates, 
stock amounts, when it is projected to go bad, record when it is gone and whether it 
needs to be ordered, if it has been ordered and arrival date, etc. Looking at Excel 
sheets is time consuming, and this application will make it faster and simpler to see 
what is out/bad, and needs to be ordered/will be arriving.
